I have created lastfmtreemap.wru.co!

The site generates a "treemap" of your scrobbles, a type of graph that displays hierarchical data using nested rectangles. The size of each rectangle corresponds to the amount of scrobbles that Artist/Album/Track has. The more scrobbled something is, the larger its rectangle.

The treemap is also interactive. Clicking on an artist will display only that artist's albums, as shown below. Hovering over any rectangle will show its name and amount of scrobbles. You may also drag and zoom around the treemap to view the smaller rectangles.

Here is an example of what it can do, using my scrobbles from this year:

And furthermore, clicking on an album will display its tracks:
